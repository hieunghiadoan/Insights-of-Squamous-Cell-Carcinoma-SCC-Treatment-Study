# Analysis of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Treatment Study - Capomulin vs. Other Regimens

**Background:**

A pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications conducted a study to explore potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors who received various drug regimens. The primary focus was to assess the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, in comparison to other treatment regimens. The study spanned 45 days, during which tumor development was monitored and measured.

**Project Objectives:**

As a senior data analyst, the following tasks were undertaken:

1. Generate all necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study.
2. Provide a top-level summary of the study results.

**Key Findings and Analysis:**

**1. Summary Statistics:**
   - Descriptive statistics were calculated for tumor volume across all drug regimens. Key measures include mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM (Standard Error of the Mean).

**2. Bar Plots:**
   - Bar plots were generated to illustrate the total number of data points for each drug regimen.

**3. Pie Chart:**
   - A pie chart was created to show the distribution of male and female mice in the study.

**4. Quartiles and Outliers:**
   - Quartile calculations and box-and-whisker plots were used to identify potential outliers in the final tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

**5. Line Plot:**
   - A line plot depicted tumor volume changes over time for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

**6. Scatter Plot:**
   - A scatter plot was used to examine the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

**7. Linear Regression:**
   - Linear regression analysis was performed to predict tumor volume based on mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen. The regression equation, correlation coefficient (r-value), and coefficient of determination (r-squared) were determined.

**8. Summary Statistics for Tumor Volume:**
   - Additional summary statistics were computed for tumor volume, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for each of the four most promising treatment regimens.

**9. Box Plots:**
   - Box plots were created to visualize the distribution of final tumor volumes for the top four treatment regimens, highlighting potential outliers.

**10. Multiple Comparisons:**
    - A statistical analysis was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the top four treatment regimens. This analysis involved ANOVA testing and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons.

**Summary of Study Results:**

- Capomulin exhibited promising results, with a noticeable decrease in tumor volume over the course of treatment.
- Among the top four treatment regimens, Capomulin had the smallest final tumor volume, indicating its potential efficacy.
- Mouse weight and tumor volume showed a positive correlation within the Capomulin regimen, with a strong r-squared value of [insert r-squared value].

**Recommendations:**

- Based on the study results, Capomulin should proceed to further clinical trials for potential SCC treatment.
- Additional research and analysis are recommended to gain a deeper understanding of Capomulin's effectiveness and safety profile.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the SCC treatment study, emphasizing the performance of Capomulin against other treatment regimens. The generated tables, figures, and summary statistics offer valuable insights for the technical report, assisting the executive team in making informed decisions regarding the future of Capomulin as a potential SCC treatment.
